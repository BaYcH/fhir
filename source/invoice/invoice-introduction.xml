		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p>
Tracking Financial information is vital in Patient Administration and Finance systems in most Healthcare Organizations.

An invoice is a financial document issued by a Healthcare provider to a patient or a payer indicating the goods and services (ChargeItems) performed with their quantities and prices.

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>
The existing Claim resource is constricted to use cases where Claims are sent to insurances for reimbursement, in a message-like style. It neither references ChargeItems nor Accounts.

This resource is used where existing ChargeItems in an Account are collected to create an Invoice to be sent out to Individuals or Organizations in a structured way.

The invoice is the hospital’s view, whereas the Claim is the payer’s view on the performed services.</p>
