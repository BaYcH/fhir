<h2>Profiling FHIR</h2>

<p>
The base FHIR specification (this specification) describes a set of base resources, frameworks
and APIs that are used in many different contexts in healthcare. However there is wide 
variance around the world and across the healthcare eco-system around 
practices, reuqirements, regulations, education, and what actions are feasible 
and/or beneficial.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, the FHIR specification is a "platform specification" - it creates
a common platform or foundation on which a variety of different solutions is implemented. 
As a consqeunce, this specification requires further adaptation to particular
contexts of use. Typically, this adaptations specify:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Rules about which elements are or are not used</li>
 <li>Rules about which API features are used, and how</li>
 <li>Rules about which terminologies and used in particular elements</li>
 <li>Descriptions of how the elements and API features map to local requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that Because of the nature of the healthcare eco-system, there may be multiple 
layers of adaptation - by country, by institution, and/or by vendor/implementation. 
</p>
<p>
The base FHIR specification provides a set of metadata /  conformance resources 
that describe how a specific solution is or should be built:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="conformance.html">Conformance</a> Resource: describes how a client or server uses the FHIR API</li>
 <li><a href="profile.html">Profile</a> Resource: describes a set of rules about how a resource is used</li>
 <li><a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a> Resource: describes a set of codes or concepts that can be used in a particular context</li>
 <li><a href="conceptmap.html">Concept Map</a> Resource: Maps between terminologies and or structures </li>
 <li><a href="operationdefinition.html">OperationDefinition</a> Resource: describes additional operations over and above the RESTful interactions defined in the specification</li>
 <li><a href="namespace.html">Namespace</a> Resource: formal definitions of system namespaces for identifiers and terminologies</li>
 <li><a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a> Resource: Description of data elements that are used across FHIR and other contexts</li>
</ul>
<p>
For implementer convenience, the specification itself publishes it's base definitions using these same resources. 
</p>
<p>
Typically, implementations or regional standards both restrict and extend APIS, resources, and terminologies. 
The basic concepts for extension are described in <a href="extensiblity.html">"Extensibility"</a>. 
Specifically, the conformance resources allow you to:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Indicate that <a href="http.html">some API calls</a> are not used for a particular use (Conforamnce Resource)</li>
 <li>Add additional <a href="operations.html">operations</a> or <a href="search.html">search parameters</a> not in the base specification (using the OperationDefinition resource, following the policy discussed below)</li>
 <li>Identify specific elements in resources that are not used (Profile resource)</li>
 <li>Define new elements that are used resources (Profile resource)</li>
 <li>Mix custom and standard terminologies, and choose which codes from these to use for a particular use (Profile and ValueSet resources)</li>
</ul>

<a name="api"> </a>
<h3>Extending and Restricting the API</h3>
<p>
A conformance resource lists the interactions (read, update, search, etc) that a server provices, or that a client uses, along with 
some supporting information for each. The only interaction that servers are required to support is the <a href="http.html#conformance">Conformance</a>
interaction itself - to retrieve the server's conformance statement. Beyond that, servers and clients support and use whichever
API calls are relevant to their use case.
</p>
<p>
In addition the operations that FHIR provides, servers are allowed to provide additional 
operations that are not part of the FHIR specification. Implementers can safely do this 
by appending '$' and an operation name to an existing FHIR URL, as the <a href="operations.html">Operations
framework</a> does. The base specification will never define operation names with a "." in them, so 
implementers are recommended to use a name such as "ihe.operation" using some appropriate prefix 
to reduce the likelihood of name conflicts. 
</p>
<p>
Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to define operations using the standard
FHIR operations framework - that is, to declare the operations using the OperationDefinition
resource, but many of these operations involve formats that can't be described that way. 
</p>
<p>
Implementations are also able to extend the FHIR API using additional content types. 
For instance, it might be useful to retrieve or update the appointment resources using a vCard
based format. vCard defines it's own mime type, and these additional mime types can 
safely be used in addition to those defined in this specification/
</p>

<a name="resources"> </a>
<h3>Extending and Restricting Resources</h3>

<p>
Extending and restricted resources is done by a "Profile" resource. 
Profile resources can declare extension, and detail where in a resource
structure they can be used, and the profile resource can also define
additional rules about how the elements in a resource are used. 
</p>

<h3>Limitations of Use</h3>
<p>
What profiles can do is limited in some respects:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Profiles cannot break the rules established in the base specification (e.g. if the element cardinality is 1..1 in the base specification, a profile cannot say it is 0..1, or 1..*)</li>
 <li>Profiles cannot specify default values or meanings for elements</li>
 <li>It must be safe to process a resource without knowing of the profile</li>
</ul>
<p>
The consequence of this is that if a profile mandates behavior that cannot 
be ignored, it must also mandate an extension with isModifier=true in the
instance. Another way of saying this is that knowledge must be explicit in
the instance, not implicit in the profile. 
</p>
<p>
As an example, if a profile wished to describe that a <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a>
resource was being engated (e.g. asserting that it never happened), it could not simply say 
in the profile itself that this is what the resource means; instead, the profile must 
say that the resource must have an extension that represents this knowledge. 
</p>


<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>
A profile specifies one or more sets of restrictions ("structures") on the content of a resource or a data type. 
Each structure has a name, which as an internal name unique in the scope of the profile that is used 
to reference the structure, and the type that it restricts, which is either a resource or data type 
defined in the FHIR specification. The following kinds of statements can be made about how a element is used:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Restricting the cardinality of the element. e.g. the base might allow 0..*, and a particular application might support 1..2</li>
 <li>Ruling out use of an element by setting its maximum cardinality to 0</li>
 <li>Making additional invariants on the content of nested elements within the resource (expressed as XPath statements)</li>
 <li>Restricting the types for an element that allows multiple types</li>
 <li>Requiring a typed element or the target of a resource reference to conform to another structure profile (declared in the same profile, or elsewhere)</li>
 <li>Specifying a binding to a different terminology value set (see below)</li>
 <li>Providing alternative definitions for the elements defined in a Resource to explain how they are used in the context of the Profile</li>
 <li>Providing more specific or additional mappings (e.g. to v2 or v3) for the resource when used in a particular context</li> 
</ul>
<p>
All of these changed definitions SHALL be restrictions that are consistent with the 
rules defined in the base resource in the FHIR Specification. Note that some of 
these restrictions can be enforced by tooling (and are by the FHIR tooling), but 
others cannot be automatically enforced.
</p>
<p>
A structure definition consists of a linear list of element declarations. The inherent 
nested structure of the elements is derived from the <i>path</i> value of each element. 
For instance, a sequence of the element paths like this:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Root</li>
 <li>Root.childA</li>
 <li>Root.childA.grandchild1</li>
 <li>Root.childB</li>
</ul>
<p>
defines the following structure:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;Root&gt;
   &lt;childA&gt;
     &lt;grandChild/&gt;
   &lt;/childA&gt;
   &lt;childB/&gt;
 &lt;/Root&gt;
</pre>
<p>
or its JSON equivalent. The structure SHALL be coherent - children are never 
implied, and the path statements SHALL always be in order. The element list is 
a linear list rather than being explicitly nested because profile structures
are frequently used in multiple places within a single profile, and this re-use
is easier in a flat structure.
</p>

<a name="snapshot"> </a>
<h3>Differential vs Snapshot</h3>
 
<p>
Structures may contain either a differential statement, or an snapshot
statement of constraints, or both.
</p>
<p>Differential statements describe only the differences that they make 
relative to another profile (which is most of then the base specification). 
For example, a profile may make a single element mandadory (cardinality 1..1).
In the case of a differential sturcture, it will contain a single element 
with the path of the element being made mandatory, and a cardinality statement.
Nothing else is stated - all the rest of the structure is implied.
</p>
<p>
In order to properly understand a differential structure, it must be 
applied to the base profile on which it is based. In order to save
tools from doing this (which is computationally intensive, or 
impossible if the base structure is not available), a structure 
can also carry a "snapshot" - a fully calculated form of the
structure that is not dependent on any other structure. The FHIR
project provides tools for the common platforms that can populate
a snapshot from a differential.
</p>
<p>
Structures can contain both a differential and a snapshot view. 
In fact, this is the most useful form - the differential 
form serves the authoring process, while the snapshot serves
the implementation tooling. Profile resources used in operational
systems should always have the snapshot view propulated.
</p>

<a name="slicing"> </a>
<h3>Slicing</h3>
<p>
One common feature of profiles is to take an element that may occur more than once (e.g. in a list), 
and describe a series of different restrictions on the elements in the list with associated 
additional meaning with each element, so that the list is split into a series of individual 
elements or sub-lists. In FHIR, this operation is known as "Slicing" a collection.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example to illustrate the process:
</p>
<img alt="Slicing diagram" src="slicing.png" width="461" height="353"/>
<p>
In this example, the base resource defines the "related" element which may occur
multiple times. Each related element has a "type" element, and a "target" element
which identifies another observation. In this diagram, the contents of the target
element are shown in the inner box instead of the showing the target reference 
explicitly. Note that to avoid adding clutter to this simplified example, the "name" 
attribute of Observation is shown as (code) not a full CodeableConcept.
</p>
<p>
The profile for Blood Pressure constrains the related element list into 
2 different elements: a systolic element, and a diastolic element. Each of these
elements has a fixed value for the type element, and a the profile also fixes the 
contents of the target observation as well, specifying a fixed LOINC code for
the name, and specifying that both have a value of type Quantity. This process
is known as "slicing" and the Systolic and Diastolic elements are called "slices".
</p>

<p>
Note that when the resource is exchanged, the wire format that is exchanged is not 
altered by the profile. This means that the item profile names defined in the 
profile ("systolic", etc. in this example) are never exchanged. A resource 
instance looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
 &lt;Observation&gt;
   ...
   &lt;related&gt;
     &lt;type value=&quot;component&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;target ...&gt;
   &lt;/related&gt;
   &lt;related&gt;
     &lt;type value=&quot;component&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;target ...&gt;
   &lt;/related&gt;
 &lt;/Observation&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The only way to determine that the first related item corresponds to "Systolic" in 
the profile is to check the values of the elements - in this case, the name element
in the target resource. 
</p>
<p>
In order to make slicing easy to use, particularly in the context of code 
generation tools that work with profiles, any time slicing is performed in 
a profile, the profile SHALL nominate a "discriminator" - a contained 
element that is used to discriminate among the different slices. 
The profile SHALL fix the value of the contained element for each
slice, or if the contained element has a terminology binding, it SHALL be 
associated with a complete binding with a version specific <a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a> 
reference that enumerates the possible codes in the value set, and where there 
is no overlap between the codes in the value sets between slices.
</p>

<p> Within a profile, a slice is defined using multiple <i>element</i>
	entries that share a <i>path</i> but have distinct
	<i>name</i>s. These entries together form a "slice group" that is:
</p>

<ol>
	       
	<li><b>Initiated by a "slicing entry"</b> That is, the first
		<i>element</i> in a slice group must contain a
		<i>slicing</i> property that defines the
		<i>discriminator</i> for all members of the group.</li>

	<li><b>Mutually exclusive</b>. This means that each
		<i>element</i> in a slice group SHALL describe a
		distinct set of  values for the group's
		<i>discriminator</i>.  Because of this constraint, an 
	        element in a resource <b>instance</b> will never match more
		than one <i>element</i> in a given slice group.</li>

	<li><b>Serialized as a group</b>. The entries in a slice
		group must be <b>adjacent</b> in a serialized Profile,
		<b>or</b>, if there are any intervening elements, those
		elements must be "compatible with" the group. Concretely, this
		means that any intervening elements must have a
		<i>path</i> that starts with the slice groups's
		<i>path</i>.  For example, an <i>element</i> with a
		<i>path</i> of <i>Observation.name.extension</i>
		would be compatible with (and thus, would not "break up") a
		slice group whose path was <i>Observation.name</i> </li>

</ol>
<p>
The value of the discriminator is either a path name that identifies
the child element using a dotted notation, or a URI, which identifies 
an extension that serves as the discriminator (and which must be found 
on the element at which the slicing occurs). In the case above, the 
discriminator is "target.name" (the fact that there is a resource
boundary between "target" and "name" is implied, not represented directly).
</p>
 
<!-- but what's the discriminator here?  todo during DSTU period...
<p>
An additional reason to use slicing is when a single element has a choice of types, and
different types need different definitions, mappings, or constraints. 
</p>
-->

<a name="extensions"> </a>
<h3>Extension Definitions</h3>
<p>
A profile can also define extensions. Some profiles only define extensions, and others define 
extensions as part of defining one or more structures. For an extension definition, the 
profile defines the code that identifies the extension. The full URI that refers to the 
extension when it is used in a resource is the identifier (from the metadata above) and 
then # + the code. 
</p>
<p>
The extension definition also defines the context where the extension can be used (usually
a particular path or a data type), and then defines it using the same details used to 
profile the structural elements.
</p>
<p>
Note that in the case of a profile that defines an extension, and then uses it, the
extension will appear both in the extension definition section, and in one or more places
in the structure defined by the profile.
</p>
<p>
For further discussion of defining and using extensions, along with some examples, 
see <a href="extensibility.html">Extensibility</a>. 
</p>

<h4>Using Extensions in Structures</h4>
<p>
Defining a extension means that it can be used in a resource somewhere. To actually
use a resource, the extension list on the resource needs to be sliced. This is shown in 
<a href="extensibility-examples.html#sliceextensions">the extensibility examples</a></p>
<p>
Note that the minimum cardinality of an extension SHALL be a valid restriction
on the minimum cardinality in the definition of the extension. if the minimum
cardinality of the extension is 1 when it is defined, it can only be mandatory
when it is added to a profile. This is not recommended - the minimum cardinality
of an extension should be 0. 
</p>


<a name="binding"> </a>
<h3>Binding Definitions</h3>

<p>
Coded elements have bindings that link from the element to a definition of the 
set of possible codes the element may contain. The binding identifies the 
definition of the set of possible codes, and controls how tightly the set of the possible codes is interpreted.
</p>
<p>
The set of possible codes is either a formal reference to a value set 
resource, which may be version specific, or a general reference to some web content that defines a set of 
codes. The second is most appropriate where set of values is defined by 
some external standard (such as mime types). Alternatively, where the binding
is incomplete (e.g. under development) just a text description of the 
possible codes can be provided. 
</p>
<p> 
Bindings have two properties that define how the set of codes is used: <i>isExtensible</i> and <i>conformance</i>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>isExtensible</b><a name="extensibility"> </a>indicates whether additional codes are allowed beyond those in the defined set of codes.</p>
    <table>
      <tr><td>false</td> <td>No additional codes are to be used beyond the list provided</td> </tr>
      <tr><td>true</td>  <td>Supplemental codes or plain text may be needed (this is common because it is reasonable to think that concepts will need to be used which won't be in the defined set of codes)</td></tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Conformance</b><a name="conformance"> </a>indicates the expectations for implementers of the specification.  
    There are three possible values:</p>
    <p/>
    <table>
      <tr><td>required</td><td>
        <p>Only codes in the specified set are allowed.</p>
        <p>
        If the strength is 'extensible', other codes may be used for concepts not covered by the 
        value set but cannot be used for concepts covered by the bound code list, even 
        if a profile constrains out some of those codes).</p>
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>preferred</td><td>
        For greater interoperability, implementers are strongly encouraged to use the bound set of
        codes, however alternate codes may be used in profiles if necessary without being considered
        non-conformant.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>example</td><td>
        The codes in the set are an example to illustrate the meaning of the field.
        There is no particular preference for its use.
      </td></tr>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The interplay between the meaning of these is subtle but sometimes important. The following table helps 
define the meanings:
</p>
<table>
 <tr><td><b>Conformance</b></td><td><b>isExtensible=false</b></td><td><b>isExtensible=true</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>Required</b></td><td>Implementers SHALL use a code from the defined set</td><td>Implementers SHALL use a code from the defined set if one is applicable, but otherwise may provide their own code or use text</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>Preferred</b></td><td>Implementers SHOULD use a code from the defined set</td><td>Implementers SHOULD use a code from the defined set if one is applicable, but MAY provide their own code or use text</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>Example</b></td><td>Implementers MAY use a code from the defined set</td><td>Implementers MAY use a code from the defined set or provide their own code or use text</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A profile can define a set of bindings that it uses directly, or it can define a set of bindings 
for re-use in other profiles. To use bindings in other profiles, just provide an absolute reference.
</p>


<a name="tx"> </a>
<h3>Mixing Custom and Standard Terminologies</h3>
<p>
<a href="valueset.html">Value Set</a> resources can be used to define local codes (Example) and 
to mix a combination of local codes and standard codes (examples: LOINC, SNOMED), or just
to choose a particular set of standard codes (examples: LOINC, SNOMED, RxNorm). 
Profiles can bind to these value sets instead of the ones defined in the base
specification, following these rules:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr> <td><b>Binding Type</b></td> <td><b>Profile Properties</b></td> <td><b>Customization Rules</b></td> </tr>

 <tr> <td>Complete</td> <td>conformance = required, extensible = false</td> <td>The value set can only contain codes contained in the value set specified by the FHIR specification</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>Incomplete</td> <td>conformance = preferred and extensible = true</td> <td>The value set can contain codes not found in the base value set. These additional codes SHOULD not have the same meaning as existing codes in the base value set</td> </tr>
 <tr> <td>Example</td> <td>conformance = example</td> <td>The value set can contain whatever is appropriate for local use</td> </tr> 
</table>
