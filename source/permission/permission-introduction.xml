<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The Permission resource is intended to capture why data can be shared. It can be applied in two complementary situations:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Describe why a specific capability or implementation is permitted to process data
</li>
<li>
Describe why a given resource or set of resources are allowed to exist and/or be shared
</li>

</ol>
<p>
The Permission model is related to privacy laws like GDPR, and it intended to support implementations meet some of regulatory requirements. For example, having a Permission  associated with an interface (data transfer) supports a registry of Processing Activities (Art. 30 of GDPR).
</p>

<!-- Describes some of the situations/use cases intended to be managed with the resource. May include a child div for "Storyboards" and "Related Specifications". The purpose of this section is to help implementers understand why the resource is needed and how it might be used. -->

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Consent</h3>
In many situations in healthcare, Consent is not necessary or a valid reason for processing data or sharing. Data can be shared due to 
<ol>
<li>
Legal reasons: For example, mandatory reporting of infectious diseases - regardless of any positive or negative consent from the patient, some diagnosis must be submitted to the authorities
</li>
Contractual reasons: For provision of services e.g. reimbursement, performing a contract requires sharing information
<li>
</li>
</ol>
