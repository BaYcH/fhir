<p>
Though FHIR Resources are primarily designed for the <a href="http.html">RESTful HTTP-based implementation</a>, it is not necessary to use a RESTful interface when exchanging the resources; one way that they can be exchanged is in the context of services. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architecture pattern using services to encapsulate and provide discreet pieces of application functionality to each other. Services communicate by invoking public interfaces and exchanging information (as parameters and outputs) in accordance with a well-defined service contract. 
</p>
<p>
Generally speaking, services are cohesive sets of functions that maintain responsibility for both data and “state” for the scope of their responsibility.  Services have a unity of function, such as Terminology Management, Identity Management, or so on, working with other services in collaboration as part of an orchestrated workflow.  Data within a service typically follows a “black box” model and is not classically exposed, instead using pre-defined interfaces to make specific behavioral requests for the service to fill.  
</p>
<p>
To relate this to FHIR, resources in a service-oriented implementation can serve two discrete roles:  either as a payload parameter, specifying information flowing into or out of a service; or in a behavioral sense, using FHIR APIs as the invocation mechanism for engaging a service.  Service APIs are often realized using either RESTful or SOAP-based interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Of note, there are potential benefits in considering usage of FHIR and SOA together.  FHIR allows for ease of implementation and ready access to data payload in an open way.  SOA has maturity around transactional integrity across distributed systems instances, providing a framework for loose-coupling and addressing pre-conditions, exception handling, and other implementation considerations of complex distributed systems.
</p>
<p>
This section illustrates different contexts to allow implementers to make informed decisions at implementation time, considering potential impacts and solution patterns to benefit specific situations.  In doing so, this section will clarify what is meant to apply SOA principles and specifications within a FHIR environment/implementation, and the converse.  It will identify the situational factors to consider, and the elements of the SOA discipline that can be applied for more effective FHIR implementation, providing a roadmap on how to optimize your implementation toolkit to make you and your team most effective.
</p>
<p>
This section is being included as FHIR offers a highly flexible framework for interoperability that can be deployed that can be used in a variety of different ways, and in ways that have the potential to hinder interoperability if not done thoughtfully or consistently.  Use of SOA patterns and approaches can mitigate this risk, limiting the potential liability resulting from the extreme flexibility of FHIR and fostering an overall framework that leads to deployment and consistency. SOA provides guidance for how components interact, how to partition responsibilities, and how to manage workflows among different parts of systems, all of which have potential utility in FHIR implementation settings.

<h3>Service References and Patterns</h3>

<p>
Generally, the definition of particular services is a domain or context specific task, and it is anticipated that this would be done as separate specifications that make use of the underlying facilities defined in this specification.  HL7 has already defined a portfolio of services that take advantage of REST- and SOAP-based interfaces, but the parameters passed to and from those services are not at present resource-based.  These are potential extension points that may lend well for FHIR implementation.  Services defined like this are able to build on the common underlying platform features defined in this specification such as REST or messaging, and add specific interactions where appropriate. Alternatively, the service interfaces can build an entirely separate implementation. 
</p>
<p>
Note that for each of the items below, there are paired sets of standards, an HL7 Standard defining the functional specification, and an OMG Technical Standard containing SOAP bindings (for all of the items below) and REST bindings (for about half of the items below).    Links to the technical specifications are provided.
</p>
<p>
The portfolio of healthcare SOA service specifications includes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>IXS (Identification and Cross-Reference Services) that identifies the characteristic of a generic identification management services  (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/IXS">www.omg.org/spec/IXS</a>)</li>
 <li>RLUS (Retrieve, Locate, Update Service) that supports the generic management resource in a SOA environment.   (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/RLUS">www.omg.org/spec/RLUS</a>)</li>
 <li>ServD (Service directory) that supports the registration and discovery of health and human-related services  (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/ServD">www.omg.org/spec/ServD</a>)</li>
 <li>CDSS (Clinical Decision Support Service) that defines a standard access interface to a clinical decision support system (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CDSS">www.omg.org/spec/CDSS</a>)</li>
 <li>CTS2 (Common Terminology Service V 2) that defines the capabilities, responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and expected behavior to support the management, maintenance, and interaction with ontologies and medical vocabulary systems (<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CTS2">www.omg.org/spec/CTS2</a>)</li>
 <li>CCS (Care Coordination Service) that provides the capabilities to support the coordination of patient care across the care continuum spanning multiple organization [emerging specification]</li>
 <li>OS (Order Service) that provides functional capabilities for ordering pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, consult and nutritional services individually or part of an order set [emerging specification].</li>
 <li>EPSS (Event Publication & Subscription Service) that provides a Service Functional Model (SFM) for services, components and systems to subscribe to clinical events of interest and receive notice when new data are available [emerging specification].</li>
 <li>UCS (Unified Communications Service) facilitates the bi-directional communication between participants (both SOA services and human participants) that is so essential for the efficient delivery and coordination of patient care [emerging specification].</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note:   FHIR-enablement of the services above is already occurring on a limited basis.  The <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015Sep/cqif/cqif.html">Clinical Quality Improvement Framework</a>  (CQIF) portion of this specification 
is an example of a technical interface and resources that have been influenced by prior SOA work.  
Similarly, this specification defines a <a href="terminology-service.html">Terminology Service</a> which 
is tightly integrated with the RESTful API (note: this terminology service has different goals than 
the CTS2 service, so they are not functionally equivalent). FHIR itself is a framework for the instantiation 
of an RLUS service. Definition of other additional services based on the service interface definitions 
provided by the HL7 SOA work group will be considered if there is sufficient interest in this.
