  <h2>
    Defining Subscription Topics
  </h2>

Below are some areas which should be considered when creating a Subscription Topic.  Anyone defining a Topic is encouraged to publish the (IG?) at (?).

	<a name="deriving" />
	<h2>
		Deriving from existing Subscription Topics
	</h2>
  <p>Implementers are encouraged to add additional filters, but cannot remove existing ones nor change the 'concept' of a SubscriptionTopic during derivation.  For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic with the same concept but a different computable definition is OK.</li>
		<li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic to expose additional canFilterBy parameters is OK.</li>
		<li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic to remove an existing canFilterBy parameter is NOT ok.</li>
		<li>Deriving a new SubscriptionTopic based on a different resource than its parent is NOT ok (e.g., start/end of medication derived from encounter).</li>
	</ul>
