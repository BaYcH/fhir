applications may need to replace Service Base URLs. This may be needed

eco-systems, local configuration may dictate that the provider of

 A person or animal receiving care at multiple organizations will therefore have its information present in multiple Patient Resources.

 What are the explicit mechanisms that should be used to synchronize them? This dynamic behavior,  is not covered at any depth (that I can see), except to suggest that a message that emulates a HL7 v2 or V3 event be employed. The entire notion of dynamic behavior of a model employing resources is not covered well. If one happens to employ RESTful services (not required AFAICS) then, yes, we have CRUD verb mappings on resources, but no real discussion of the dynamic behavior of multiple resources involved in transactions/events, except to fall back on HL7 v2 and V3. Am I missing something?

Each resource has a known identity, which is a URL. The identity is not stored
inside the resource, but must be tracked by systems handling resources. For
RESTful systems, the resource identity is the same as the URL by which it is found.
When a resource is packaged in a <a href="bundle.html">bundle</a> (e.g. for
<a href="messaging.html">messages</a>, <a href="documents.html">documents</a>, or
<a href="services.html">exchanged in a service</a>), the id is included along
with the resource. When systems using FHIR resources are deployed in an implementation
context where there are more than two systems exchanging resources, the way that
resources are identified with URLs needs to be managed carefully.
</p>

<p>
Note that many resources also have an identifier element, and usually there can be
multiple identifiers. This identifier is a logical identifier for the concept that
the resource describes, and is different from the identity discussed in this section,
which is the literal identity of the resource. Note that there are often multiple
resource instances that describe the same concept across multiple systems, e.g. each
application keeps its own copy of the patient information in a
<a href="patient.html">Patient</a> resource. This can even exist within a single
system, such as in the case of <a href="patient.html#links">patient duplicates</a>).
</p>

<p>
Some resources have a special identifier, which is constrained to be a proper URI,
and which is known as the 'canonical URL' for the resource. These resources are 
referred to by this URI, which is encouraged to be an actual URL that resolves 
to a web page (or web service) that describes the content (hence 'canonical URL'
not 'canonical URI', though this is also for legacy purposes).
</p>

<h3>Using Resources</h3>

<p>
Resources are used in a variety of circumstances. Generally, these can be categorized into 3 different scenarios:
</p>
<ol>
 <li><b>Closed Trading System</b>: the resources are only ever exchanged between fixed systems in a tightly controlled
community, such as a single EHR system with multiple modules. There is only one master server for each resource type, and resources are managed
by that server. In this context, the <a href="resource.html#id">logical id</a> of a resource is sufficient
to fully identify the resource</li>

 <li><b>Open system</b>: there are many peer servers, each managing a set of resources of different types.
In order to identify resources, a full URL reference to the origin server is required. The grand example of
an open system is the World Wide Web</li>

 <li><b>Partially closed, inter-linked systems</b>: a mixture of both closed and open systems - trading communities that are tightly managed, but have managed
interactions with other closed trading systems, or with the world-wide web, or both. In fact,
this combination appears to be the most likely scenario for current real-world healthcare business solutions</li>
</ol>
<p>
These combinations are why either relative (logical) or absolute references are allowed, and why
a logical id is always required, in order to enable seamless exchange amongst partially closed trading systems.
</p>
<a name="distributed"></a>
<h3>Copying Resources and Re-identification</h3>
<p>
When resources are exchanged between systems, they may need to be re-identified (i.e. assigned a new logical resource id).
When a resource is re-identified, nothing in the resource change other than the <a href="resource-definitions.html#Resource.id">Resource.id</a>, 
but any references that point to the resource need to be updated. Whether re-identification is required or not depends on the context, as does how resource
references are updated.
</p>
<p>
The normal case is that a client/receiving system accepts the server/sender's identification of a resource
at face value, whether it is a relative or absolute reference. When the client/receiver wants to follow
resource references, they are done using the server id (typically either by http calls or locating them
in a <a href="bundle.html">bundle</a>), but other arrangements are possible. In such cases, there is no need for re-identification.
</p>
<p>
Another scenario is for a client to retrieve a resource from a server, and make its own local persistent
copy. If the local resource has a life-cycle of its own (i.e. it is not just a cached resource), then it
needs to have its own identity; i.e. the resource must be re-identified. The simplest case is that the
client is only keeping local copies of resources from a single server. In these cases, the client can
simply replace the Base URL and keep the logical id of the resource the same. In fact, if the server
is using relative references, then this change doesn't involve any actual changes to the resources, it only
means a re-interpretation of the references.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, however, the client may deal with multiple servers. In this case, the logical id of the
resource is not guaranteed to be unique (unless all resources have a UUID for the logical id, which is
allowed but not required). When the client cannot be sure that the resource identities are unique, it
will have to re-identify the resources. In practice this means that the client needs to keep some kind of
identity translation table, and update references to the resources it has copied locally when other resources
are received.
</p>
<p>
The case of a gateway system that migrates resources from one ecosystem to another is very similar.
In some limited cases, it can leave the logical id of the resources unchanged as resources are copied
from one closed system to another. However, in more complicated cases, it will have to modify the
resource references as resources pass across the gateway.
</p>
<blockquote class="implementer-note">
<p>
<b>Implementer Note:</b>  In its current form, FHIR allows various convenient implementer practices around
resource identification that make integration across eco-system boundaries more difficult.
In particular, either only allowing UUIDs for logical IDs or only allowing absolute references
would make the boundary management problem easier but remove useful and convenient flexibility for
other uses of FHIR. Implementers should design their systems accordingly.
</p>

<h3>Consistent Resource Identification</h3>
<p>
Irrespective of changes to the <a href="resource.html#id">logical id</a>, the other identifiers 
in the resource (typically, <code>.identifier</code> and <code>.url</code>) remain unchanged 
as the resource moves from system to system, and these are the preferred basis to recognise
the same content on different systems. E.g.
</p>
<pre>
  GET http://a.company.example.com/Patient/23
  
  &lt;Patient xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
    &lt;id value=&quot;23&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;identifier&gt;  
      &lt;system value=&quot;http://a.particular.system/identifier&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;value value=&quot;123456&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/identifier&gt;
  &lt;/Patient&gt;

  GET http://other.company.example.com/fhir/Patient/5860200e-0ee3-42f5-8095-506e18dc9ca2
  
  &lt;Patient xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;
    &lt;id value=&quot;5860200e-0ee3-42f5-8095-506e18dc9ca2&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;identifier&gt;  
      &lt;system value=&quot;http://a.particular.system/identifier&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;value value=&quot;123456&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/identifier&gt;
  &lt;/Patient&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Given this, the patient resources can be interpreted to mean that they describe the same
patient. For this reason, systems SHOULD:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Only assign identifiers to resources when they uniquely identify the real world entity that the resources match (e.g. do not use account numbers as patient identifiers when multiple different patients share the same account number)</li>
 <li>Preserve identifiers as much as possible and not throw them away. Even if the identifiers are not useful to the system itself, they are likely to be useful to downstream consumers</li>
 <li>When serving resources, use consistent identifiers from the master persistent store where ever possible (e.g. when a resource is created from a primary record, populate the identifier, and store the identifier somewhere so the same identifier is used next time)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Following these practices will make for consistent identification of concepts and real-world entities across 
healthcare eco-systems. For example, medication orders can be represented as 
<a href="medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a> and <a href="medicationstatement.html">MedicationStatement</a>. 
Some systems - primary sources - will provide the medication order as a MedicationRequest 
while other secondary systems will provide them as a MedicationStatement. Any system processing 
the resources will need to reconcile these, and the presence of consistent identifiers will 
considerably simplify the reconciliation process.
</p>

<p>
This specification provides two other related methods by which common source derivation can be indicated:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> - resources that have provenance statements where <a href="provenance-definitions.html#Provenance.entity.what_x_">Provenance.entity.what[x]</a> refers to the same source, and the .entity.role is <code>derivation</code></li>
 <li><a href="resource-definitions.html#Meta.source">Resource.meta.source</a> - two resources that have the same source</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the granularity of <a href="provenance-definitions.html#Provenance.entity.what_x_">Provenance.entity.what[x]</a> / <a href="resource-definitions.html#Meta.source">Resource.meta.source</a>
is not fixed to a single resource - multiple resources can be derived from a single source entity (e.g. a single CDA document), so applications need to be careful assuming
that matching entity source information means that the resources are identifying the same real world concept.
