However
applications may need to replace Service Base URLs. This may be needed
as application URLs may change or in uses of FHIR within internal
eco-systems, local configuration may dictate that the provider of
a resource is different to that claimed by any particular provider
or consumer.

 A person or animal receiving care at multiple organizations will therefore have its information present in multiple Patient Resources.

 What are the explicit mechanisms that should be used to synchronize them? This dynamic behavior,  is not covered at any depth (that I can see), except to suggest that a message that emulates a HL7 v2 or V3 event be employed. The entire notion of dynamic behavior of a model employing resources is not covered well. If one happens to employ RESTful services (not required AFAICS) then, yes, we have CRUD verb mappings on resources, but no real discussion of the dynamic behavior of multiple resources involved in transactions/events, except to fall back on HL7 v2 and V3. Am I missing something?

This page documents a restricted subset of the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhirpath">FHIRPath language</a> that 
is used in a few contexts in this specification. When the restricted
FHIRPath language subset is in use, the following rules apply:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>All statements SHALL start with the name of the context element (e.g. on a Patient resource, Patient.contact.name.)</li>
 <li>Operators SHALL not be used</li>
 <li>Only the following functions may be used:
   <ul>
    <li>.resolve()</li>
    <li>.extension("url")</li>
    <li>.ofType(type)</li>
   </ul>
   All other functions SHALL NOT be used
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
These rules exist to keep processing the path simple to support use of the path by processors that are not backed by a full FHIRPath implementation.
</p>
<p>
The following locations use this restricted FHIRPath language:

 <li><a href="elementdefinition-definitions.html#ElementDefinition.slicing.discriminator.path">ElementDefinition.slicing.discriminator.path</a></li>
 <li><a href="metadatatypes-definitions.html#DataRequirement.dateFilter.path">DataRequirement.dateFilter.path</a></li>
