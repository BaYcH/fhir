<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
    <p>
        A referral is a common clinical task where one clinician asks another to manage some aspect
        of a patients care. This can either be part of a patients care, or a complete transfer of the care.
        </p>
    <p>It is also possible for a patient to make a referral directly (often termed a 'self referral')
    </p>
    <p>
        The workflow around the referral is managed by the Order/OrderResponce resources, with the 
        ReferralRequest containing the clincial details. 
    </p>
