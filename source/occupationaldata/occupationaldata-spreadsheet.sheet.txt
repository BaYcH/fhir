  Binding Name = EmploymentStatus
  Binding = value set
  Reference = valueset-employment-status-odh
  Definition = A value set consisting of codes pertaining to a person’s current economic relationship to a job. Employment status refers to whether a person is currently working for compensation, is unemployed (i.e., searching for work for compensation), or is not in the labor force (e.g. disabled, homemaker, chooses not to work, etc.). Employment status is not the same as classification of work.

  Reference = valueset-occupation-cdc-census-2010
  Definition = A value set consisting of all codes from the 2010 Occupation coding system used by CDC (NIOSH & NCHS) for coding a person\'s type of work. Occupation describes a set of activities or tasks that an individual is paid to perform or, if unpaid, define the person’s contribution to a household/family business/community. This code system includes 2010 U.S. Census Bureau occupation codes with modifications made by CDC for unpaid workers and military occupations. The 2010 Census occupation categories are based on the 2010 BLS Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. The PH_Industry_CDC_Census2010 code system should be used in conjunction with this occupation code system when coding both industry and occupation.

This industry code system includes 2007 U.S. Census Bureau industry codes and additional codes developed by CDC for unpaid workers. The 2010 Census industry categories are based on the 2007 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The PH_Occupation_CDC_Census2010 code system should be used in conjunction with this industry code system when coding both industry and occupation.
