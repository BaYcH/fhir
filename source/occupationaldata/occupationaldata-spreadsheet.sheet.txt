 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = OccupationCDCCensus2010
  Binding = value set
  Reference = valueset-occupation-cdc-census-2010
  Definition = A set of activities or tasks that individuals are paid to perform or, if unpaid, define a person’s contribution to a household/family business/community. The same occupation can exist in different industry sectors (e.g., the occupation “secretary” can be found in the construction industry or a funeral home business).
  Description = 2010 Occupation coding system used by CDC (NIOSH & NCHS) for coding occupation text. Occupation describes a set of activities or tasks that individuals are paid to perform or, if unpaid, define a person’s contribution to a household/family business/community. This code system includes 2010 U.S. Census Bureau occupation codes with modifications made by CDC for unpaid workers and military occupations. The 2010 Census occupation categories are based on the 2010 BLS Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. The PH_Industry_CDC_Census2010 code system should be used in conjunction with this occupation code system when coding both industry and occupation. For more information and instructions on using this coding system, see the instruction manual for CDC-Census I&O coding at: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coding/

  Binding = value set
  Reference = valueset-industry-cdc-census-2010
  Definition = The type(s) of business (industry) associated with the patient\'s past and present occupation(s). According to CDC, \"industry\" is described as an economic or business sector comprised of businesses or enterprises concerned with the output of a specified category of products or services (e.g., the construction industry or the agriculture industry).
  Description = 2010 Industry coding system used by CDC (NIOSH & NCHS) for coding industry text. Industry describes an economic/business sector comprised of businesses/ enterprises concerned with the output of a specified category of products or services (e.g., the construction industry or the agriculture industry). This industry code system includes 2007 U.S. Census Bureau industry codes and three additional codes developed by CDC for unpaid workers. The 2010 Census industry categories are based on the 2007 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The PH_Occupation_CDC_Census2010 code system should be used in conjunction with this industry code system when coding both industry and occupation.

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = WorkSchedule
  Binding = value set
  Reference = valueset-work-schedule-odh
  Definition = Describes an individual\'s typical arrangement of working hours for an occupation. For example, work schedule may capture that an individual typically works a regular day shift, evening shift, or night shift. It can also specify if an individual has an irregular schedule such as a rotating shift, split shift, etc. In healthcare settings, knowledge of a patient\'s typical work schedule may assist in diagnosis of healthcare issues related to irregular work hours or sleep patterns. It may also assist in determining appropriate treatment and prevention plans that will coordinate with the patient\'s work schedule.
