        <b>Note to balloters</b> The Orders and Observations work-group wants to draw the attention of reviewers and implementers to the following significant changes to this resource:</p>

      <ol>
        <li> The <a href="#usingcodepairs">guidance</a> on using code value pairs to represent observations in FHIR</li>
        <li>
          <em>Breaking Change</em> The replacement of the <code>.related</code> complex element with direct inline elements based on the types listed in <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/valueset-observation-relationshiptypes.html">ObservationRelationshipType</a>:<ul>
            <li>
              <a href="observation-definitions.html#Observation.derivedFrom">.derivedFrom</a>and          </li>
            <li>
              <a href="observation-definitions.html#Observation.hasMember">.hasMember</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
              This change allows for more flexibility in adding additional reference targets as well as a simplifying the structure. The other relationship types were considered to be outside the 80% and only <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/observation-sequel-to">sequel-to</a> and <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/observation-replaces">replaces</a> were made into standard extensions referencing a target Observation.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Breaking Change</em>  The removal of the <code>Attachment</code> data type as a choice for <code>.value[x]</code>.   As a result of 2, direct links to <a href="media.html">Media</a> were added.  Observations that require the attachment data types are represented by the Media resource.  This change eliminates the ambiguity and duplication on how to represent multimedia observations.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Substantive Change</em> The promotion of the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/extension-event-partof.html">event-partOf extension</a>  to an <a href="observation-definitions.html#Observation.partOf">inline element</a>. This allows a direct reference to an event  in which the observation was made (for example a procedure).
        </li>
         <li>
          <em>Substantive Change</em> The promotion and expansion of the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/extension-observation-focal-subject.html">focal-subject extension</a>  to an <a href="observation-definitions.html#focus">inline element</a>. This allows a direct reference to a resource if the actual focus of an observation when it is not the patient of record. A simple example is provided <a href="http://build.fhir.org/observation-example-trachcare.html">here</a>.  Note that there is still the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/extension-observation-focus-code.html">focus-code</a> extension for when the focus is a code.
        </li>
        <li> The <em>Scope and Boundaries</em> section below has been rewritten to acknowledge the potential for Observation to be used instead of other resource and provide some overarching guidance on when other resources are more appropriate.</li>
        <li>Review of the <a href="observation-profiles.html#extensions">standard event extensions</a> which are the result of alignment with the workflow <a href="event.html">Event</a> pattern</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
    <p>This resource is an <a href="workflow.html#event">
        <em>event resource</em>
      </a> from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.</p>
    <p>Observations are a central element in healthcare, used to support diagnosis, monitor progress, determine baselines and patterns and even capture demographic characteristics.  Most observations are simple name/value pair assertions with some metadata, but some observations group other observations together logically, or even are multi-component observations. Note that the  <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a> resource provides a clinical or workflow context for a set of observations and the Observation resource is referenced by DiagnosticReport to represent laboratory, imaging, and other clinical and diagnostic data to form a complete report. </p>
    <p>Uses for the Observation resource include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vital signs such as <a href="observation-example.html">body weight</a>,  <a href="observation-example-bloodpressure.html">blood pressure</a>, and <a href="observation-example-f202-temperature.html">temperature</a>
      </li>
      <li>Laboratory Data like <a href="observation-example-f001-glucose.html">blood glucose</a>, or an <a href="observation-example-f205-egfr.html">estimated GFR</a>
      </li>
      <li>Imaging results like  <a href="observation-example-bmd.html">bone density</a> or fetal measurements</li>
      <li>Clinical Findings such as  <a href="observation-example-abdo.html">abdominal tenderness</a> (Note that the boundaries between clinical findings and disorders remains a challenge in medical ontology.  Refer the <a href="#bnr">Boundaries</a> section below and in <a href="condition.html#bnr">Condition</a> for general guidance.  These boundaries can be clarified by profiling Observation for a particular use case.)
      </li>
      <li>Device measurements such as  <a href="observation-example-sample-data.html">EKG data</a> or  <a href="observation-example-satO2.html">Pulse Oximetry data</a>
      </li>
      <li>Clinical assessment tools such as <a href="observation-example-5minute-apgar-score.html">APGAR</a> or a <a href="observation-example-glasgow.html">Glasgow Coma Score</a>
      </li>
      <li>Personal characteristics: such as  <a href="observation-example-eye-color.html">eye-color</a>
      </li>
      <li>Social history like tobacco use,  family support, or cognitive status</li>
      <li>Core characteristics like pregnancy status, or a death assertion</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Core Profiles for Observation</h3>
    <p>The following core <a href="profiling.html">profiles</a> for the Observation resource have been defined as well. If implementations use this Resource when expressing the profile-specific concepts as structured data, they <strong>SHALL</strong> conform to the following profiles:</p>
    <table class="grid">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="text-align:center;">Profile</th>
          <th style="text-align:center;">Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="width:15%;text-align:center;">
            <a href="observation-vitalsigns.html">Vital signs</a>
          </td>
          <td>The FHIR Vital Signs profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation Resource to record, search and fetch the vital signs (e.g. temperature, blood pressure, respiration rate, etc.) associated with a patient </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
    <p>
At its core, Observation allows expressing a name-value pair or structured collection of name-value pairs. As such, it can support conveying any type of information desired. However, that is not its intent. Observation is intended for capturing measurements and subjective point-in-time assessments. It is not intended to be used for those specific contexts and use cases already covered by other FHIR resources.   For example, the <a href="allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a> resource represents a patient allergies, <a href="medicationstatement.html">MedicationStatement</a> resource: medications taken by a patient, <a href="familymemberhistory.html"> FamilyMemberHistory</a> resource: a patient's family history, <a href="procedure.html">Procedure</a> resource: information about a procedure, and <a href="questionnaireresponse.html">QuestionnaireResponse</a> resource: a set of answers to a set of questions. The Observation resource should not be used to record clinical diagnosis about a patient or subject that are typically captured in the <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource or the ClinicalImpression resource.  The Observation resource is often referenced by the Condition resource to provide specific subjective and objective data to support its assertions.  There will however be situations of overlap. For example, a response to a question of "have you ever taken illicit drugs" could in principle be represented using MedicationStatement, but most systems would treat such an assertion as an Observation.  In some cases, such as when source data is coming from an <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185">HL7 v2</a> feed, a system might not have information that allows it to distinguish diagnosis, allergy and other "specialized" types of observations from laboratory, vital sign and other observation types intended to be conveyed with this resource.  In those circumstances, such specialized observations may also appear using this resource. Adhering to such convention is an appropriate use of Observation. If implementers are uncertain whether a proposed use of Observation is appropriate, they're encouraged to consult with implementers on <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/"> chat.fhir.org implementer's stream</a>
    </p>
  <p>
  The <a href="media.html">Media</a> resource captures a specific type of observation whose value is audio, video or image data. This resource is used instead of Observation to represent such forms of information as it exposes the metadata relevant for interpreting the information.   See Media's <a href="media.html#bnr">boundaries section</a> to see how Media (and Observation) differs from <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> and <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  In contrast to the Observation resource, the <a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a> resource typically includes additional clinical context and some mix of atomic results, images, imaging reports, textual and coded interpretation, and formatted representations.  Laboratory reports, pathology reports, and imaging reports should be represented using the DiagnosticReport resource. The Observation resource is referenced by the DiagnosticReport to provide the atomic results for a particular investigation.  "Laboratories routinely have a variable that is summative across a series of discrete variables - these are usually called 'impressions' or 'interpretations'. Sometimes they are algorithmically specified and sometimes they have the imprimatur of pathologists and they are conveyed in Observation or DiagnosticReport instead of the <a href="clinicalimpression.html">Clinical Impression</a> resource.  The Observation resource should not be used to record clinical diagnosis about a patient or subject as discussed above.
