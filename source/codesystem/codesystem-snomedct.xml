SNOMED CT is a poly-versioned code system for which multiple 
releases exist. This CodeSystem resource describes 'all of SCT'.
For the relevent elements, there are notes about how they would 
change to describe specific editions, or specific versions.

In addition to this general canonical SNOMED CT definition, 
servers generate variants of this to describe how they 
support a particular edition/version
