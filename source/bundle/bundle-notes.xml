<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The content of bundled resources SHALL always be present except in the special case of a transaction response.</li>
<li>Conceptually, a bundle is a list of resources with named links. Since a Bundle is itself a <a href="resource.html">Resource</a> it has the common metadata, including profile assertions and tags.</li>
<li>Bundle has a 'base' element, which is used to resolve relative references present in the bundled resources.</li>
<li>Applications reading a bundle should always <a href="references.html#atom-refs">look for a resource</a> by its identity (after converting relative URLs to
absolute URL) in the bundle first before trying to access it by its URL.</li>
</ul>
