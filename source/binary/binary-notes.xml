<h3>Serving Binary Resources using the RESTful API</h3>

<p>
The Binary resources behaves slightly differently to all other resources on the RESTful API.
speifically, when a read request is made for the binary resource that doesn't explicitly
specify the FHIR content types "application/xml+fhir" or "application/json+fhir", then 
the content should be returned using the content type stated in the resource. 
e.g. if the content type in the resource is application/pdf, then the content should
be returned as a PDF directly. 
</p>
<p>
Note that due to the way the web infastructure works, it is not possible to make blanket
rules about the relationship between the "Accept" field in the http request, and the 
return type, which is why there is no hard rule about this. However the intent is that
unless specifically requested, the FHIR XML/JSON representation is not returned. 
</p>
<p>
Note that in the native binary represnetation, the metadata is not available directly,
though some of it is replicated in the HTTP response headers.
