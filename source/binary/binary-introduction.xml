<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
There are situations where it is useful or required to handle pure binary content using the same framework as other 
resources. Typically, this is when the binary content is referred to from other FHIR Resources. 
Using the same framework means that the existing servers, security arrangements, code libraries etc. 
can handle additional related content. Typically, Binary resources are used for handling content such as:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> Documents (i.e. with XDS)</li>
 <li>PDF Documents</li>
 <li>Images (the Media resource is preferred for handling images, but not possible when the content is already binary - XDS)</li>
</ul>
<p>
A binary resource can contain any content, whether text, image, pdf, zip archive, etc. These 
resources are served in their native form on the rest interface, but can also be represented in XML or JSON, 
such as when including these resources in a Bundle (used when it is convenient to include these in the 
response directly rather than leaving them by reference).

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
When a FHIR server finds it convenient to manage the content within the same overall REST framework 
as the other resources, the Binary resource is generally used as the target in the 
<a href="datatypes.html#Attachment">Attachment</a> data type to reference content via the <code>.url</code> 
element, such as in the DocumentReference and Media resources. Consequently, the Binary resource can 
be a target wherever the Attachment data type is used such as in the DocumentReference resource.
