<h2>DSTU 2 Ballot Welcome</h2>
<p>
Hello and welcome to the second FHIR DSTU ballot!
</p>
<p>
This specification represents a series of significant changes and enhancements from the first FHIR Draft Standard for Trial Use
specification HL7 published in January, 2014.  It includes a number of new resources including support for claims and scheduling
as well as publish/subscribe and operations.  It also includes changes resulting from over 1500 change proposals submitted by
implementers and other readers of the specification.  A complete list of changes can be found <a href="history.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
While FHIR is not yet "normative", this specification is the product of many thousands of hours of development,
including several ballot cycles, multiple QA cycles, 8 Connectathons and production of a number of reference and proof of concept 
implementations.  Subsets of FHIR have been implemented or are currently being implemented on all continents other than Antartica.
Therefore we hope that you find the specification already close to an implementable state.
</p>
<p>
The FHIR specification is presented as a series of interlinked HTML pages.  They can either be reviewed online or can be
<a href="fhir-spec.zip">downloaded</a> for exploration on your own device.  (70MB zip, 550MB unzipped).
 You can review whichever links are of interest in any 
order you wish.  However, to ensure a base level understanding of the specification we recommend that you click on the 
<a href="documentation.html">Documentation</a> link and read through at least the following:
</p>
<p>
For context:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview/<a href="summary.html">1 page Summary (Glossy)</a></li>
  <li>Overview/<a href="overview-dev.html">Developer's Introduction</a></li>
  <li>Overview/<a href="overview-clinical.html">Clinical Introduction</a></li>
  <li>Overview/<a href="overview.html">Overview &amp; Roadmap</a></li>
  <li>Overview/<a href="timelines.html">FHIR Timelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
To see scope:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the <a href="resourcelist.html">Resources</a> link at the top to get a sense of what resources exist and maybe drill into a couple of them to see what 
  they look like before coming back to the Documentation tab for more context</li>
</ul>
<p>
To understand base approach:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resources/<a href="resource.html">Base Resource</a></li>
  <li>Resources/<a href="domainresource.html">DomainResource</a></li>
  <li>Resources/<a href="narrative.html">Narrative</a></li>
  <li>Resources/<a href="formats.html">Formats: XML, JSON</a></li>
  <li>Resources/<a href="extensibility.html">Extensibility</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
To understand key infrastructure:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resources/<a href="datatypes.html">Data Types</a></li>
  <li>Terminologies/<a href="terminologies.html">Using Codes in Resources</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
For context for this ballot:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Administration/<a href="todo.html">Outstanding Issues</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Feel free to drill down into any other sections of interest.  If you want to ensure a complete review of the whole spec, the 
Documentation/Administration/<a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a> may be a useful guide.
</p>
<p>
A few notes to consider:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not all of the outstanding issues will be resolved prior to the DSTU ballot passing.  Some may be left open to allow feedback 
  from the early adopter community.</li>
  <li>This specification is complete enough to be implementable in a variety of healthcare scenarios, including supporting all content 
  from the Consolidated CDA implementation guide.  However, the set of resources is not complete.  Resources may evolve and new ones 
  will be introduced over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When submitting your ballot feedback, if you have a general comment on something that you see occurring multiple times, please include 
at least a couple of specific locations where you see the issue.  As much as possible, capture each separate concern as a distinct row 
in the ballot sheet or separate <a href="">tracker item</a>.  (If using tracker items for your submissions, you <b>MUST</b> still
submit a ballot spreadsheet referencing the relevant tracker items.)  It makes our job of reconciling much easier.  Also, donâ€™t forget to 
fill in the section numbers (little grey numbers to the right of each heading) and URLs.
</p>
<p>

Thanks for taking the time to review the FHIR specification.  We appreciate any feedback you can provide.
