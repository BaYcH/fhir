		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p>
			Slot resources are used to provide time-slots that can be booked using an appointment.
			They do not provide any information about appointments that are available, just the time,
			and optionally what the time can be used for. These are effectively spaces of free/busy time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The slot can have more than one appointment allocated to it. The scheduling system may permit
			this up to a specific number of places. An example of this type of usage could be where the slot
			is being used for a group service that permits 5 participants at the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			A slot can be marked as over-booked indicating that there are too many appointments allocated
			to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some situations a service may have a specific set of slots reserved for specific uses, such 
			as "walk-ins" or a specific Organisation has a "standing booking" for Thursday mornings.
			These should be represented using the type field with a specified and agreed value.<br/>
			Security Permissions or specific business rules on the system could enforce that only eligible
			appointments are allocated to them.
