<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>
Workflow is an essential part of healthcare - orders, care protocols, referrals are the drivers of most activity within in-patient settings and a great deal of activity in
community care as well.  FHIR is concerned with workflow when there's a need to share information about workflow state or relationships, when there's a need to coordinate
or drive the execution of workflow across systems and when there's a need to define allowed actions, dependencies and conditions on behavior.
</p>
<p><b>Workflow state &amp; relationships</b></p>
<p>
FHIR does not need to be used for the execution of workflow.  Orders, care plans, lab results, hospital admissions, claim payments and other records can all be shared using
FHIR without the process to actually solicit fulfillment of those orders or requesting payment of those claims being driven by a FHIR transaction.  Interoperable support for
workflow execution is actually a more advanced FHIR activity because it requires a higher degree of standardization.  Rather than merely standardizing the data to exchange,
interoperable workflow execution requires standardization of the processes, roles and activities of the different systems.  However, even without using FHIR for
workflow execution, there's still a need to standardize the data elements related to workflow: how does an event or a result point to the order that authorized it?  How do
parent steps and child steps get linked together?  How does a care plan identify what protocol it's adhering to?
</p>
<p>
FHIR defines three categories of resources that are involved in activities - <a href="#request">requests</a>, <a href="#event">events</a> and 
<a href="#definition">definitions</a>.  Each of these different types has a "pattern" associated with that resources that fall into that category are encouraged to adhere to.
These patterns provide standard elements that are typical for most resources of each type.  Strict adherence is not required as work groups are expected to align with
typical domain behavior and requirements as more authoritative than "desired" architectural patterns.  In some cases, capabilities might be supported with extensions rather than
core elements where a pattern capability is deemed to be "not common, but still relevant" for a given resource.
</p>
<p>
A full description of the patterns and their interrelationships can be found in the <a href="#respatterns">Workflow Resource Patterns</a> section of this page.
</p>
<p><b>Workflow execution</b></p>
<p>
In addition to defining patterns for resources used in workflow processes, FHIR supports the execution of those processes as well.  However, FHIR does not define a "one size 
fits all" solution for workflow architecture.  FHIR supports a variety of interoperability paradigms and most of them (<a href="http.html">REST</a>,
<a href="messaging.html">Messaging</a> and <a href="services.html">Services</a> provide support for driving workflow execution.  (The <a href="documents.html">Document</a>
paradigm does not directly support driving behavior, though it can be combined with one of the other patterns to do so.)  In addition, several of these paradigms allow multiple
approaches to supporting workflow, depending on the context and needs of the workflow process.
</p>
<p>The <a href="#commpatterns">Workflow Communication Patterns</a> section of this page describes a number of options for workflow execution, summarizes their respective pros 
and cons and makes recommendations for the circumstances in which they might best be used.</p>
<p><b>Workflow definition</b></p>
<p>
The definition of protocols, order sets, guidelines and other structures that define what sorts of activities should occur, what order they should occur on, what dependencies
they have, in what circumstances they should start or end, etc. is handled by a pair of resources:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="plandefinition.html">PlanDefinition</a> defines the interrelationships of steps and the rules around their execution</li>
  <li><a href="activitydefinition.html">ActivityDefinition</a> defines an activity to be performed as a single step</li>
</ul>
<p>
The use of these two artifacts is documented TODO.

<h3>Workflow Resource Patterns</h3>
<p>Not all resources in FHIR are related to workflow - many are used to describe entities and roles (patients, medications, etc.) or infrastructure (structure definitions,
value sets, etc.).  However, a large proportion of the FHIR resources are devoted to the description of activities in one fashion or another and almost all of these fall
into the realm of workflow - they describe things that can be done (definitions), are desired to be done (requests) or that have been done (events).  The table below
summarizes the list of workflow-relevant resources:</p>
