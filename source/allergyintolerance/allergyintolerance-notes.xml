<h3>Negated Allergies and Intolerances</h3>

<p>It is important to differentiate between affirmatively stating that a patient has no known allergies versus either
not including allergies in the record (for example an episodic document where the allergies are not considered 
relevant to the document); or asserting that allergies were not reviewed and are unknown.</p>

<p>Allergies with the status "entered-in-error" are considered to be inactive allergies.</p>
<p>Allergies with the status "refuted" must be displayed to indicate that a reaction to a substance has been ruled out
with the high level of clinical certainty (e.g. additional testing, rechallenging). </p>
<p>Prior to adding a new allergy/intolerance, a list of existing negated and refuted reactions should be reviewed
and reconciled.</p>

<p>
<b>Allergies Not Reviewed</b>
</p>
<p>If a sending system does not have any information about allergies being reviewed, then the <a href="list.html">List</a> resource 
should be used to indicate the List.emptyReason.code="notasked".</p>
<p>
<b>Allergies Reviewed, None Identified</b>
</p>
<p>If allergies are reviewed and none are identified, then the corresponding negation code should be populated 
in the AllergyIntolerance.substance.code of a resource. A set of codes to negate all kinds of allergies or a specific group of allergies 
has been added to the <a href="valueset-allergyintolerance-substance-code.html">AllergyIntolerance Substance</a> value set.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>No Known Allergies</p>
<pre>
  &lt;substance&gt;
    &lt;coding&gt;
      &lt;system value=&quot;http://snomed.info/sct‎&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;value value=&quot;160244002&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;display value=&quot;No Known Allergies&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/coding&gt;
  &lt;/substance&gt;
</pre>
<p>No Known Food Allergies</p>
<pre>
  &lt;substance&gt;
    &lt;coding&gt;
      &lt;system value=&quot;http://snomed.info/sct‎&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;value value=&quot;429625007&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;display value=&quot;No Known Food Allergies&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/coding&gt;
  &lt;/substance&gt;
</pre>
</div>



<blockquote>
<p>DSTU note: There are two ways of reporting "No Known Allergies" in the current specification: using the CodeableConcept,
as described above, or using the <a href="list.html">List</a> resource. During the trial use period for this DSTU, it is not recommended
to use the <a href="list.html">List</a> resource for "No Known Allergies" reporting purposes. FHIR group is seeking feedback from 
implementers in this area to resolve this ambiguity.
</p>

<h3>Use of AllergyIntolerance.criticality</h3>
<p>
Systems that only support one notion will have to determine whether what they're capturing is criticality or severity and 
map to the appropriate place.  Criticality refers to the likelihood the allergy/intolerance could result in significant 
harm.  Severity refers to the degree of manifestation of the reaction symptom.  Moderate breathing difficulty would have 
high criticality while a severe rash would have low criticality. Severity is specific to a particular reaction occurrence.
</p>
<p>
For systems that only track generic reaction characteristics rather than a specific reaction will provide guidance to use 
the "reaction" structure and simply provide no date.
