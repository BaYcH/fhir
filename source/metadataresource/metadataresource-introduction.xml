<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The MetadataResource serves as the base type for resources that carry publication metadata:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>They have a canonical URL (note: all resources with a canonical URL are specializations of this type)</li>
 <li>They have version, status, and data properties to help manage their publication</li>
 <li>They carry metadata about their use, including copyright information</li>
</ul>

<p>
As an abstract resource, this resource is never created directly; instead, one of its descendant resources (<a href="resourcelist.html">see List of Resources</a>) is created.
