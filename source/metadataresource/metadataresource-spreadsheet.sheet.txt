 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource
  Card. = 1..1

  Type = DomainResource
  Short Name = Common Ancestor declaration for definitional resources
  Definition = Common Ancestor declaration for conformance and knowledge artifact resources
  w5 = conformance.behavior

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.url
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = y
  Type = uri
  Short Name = Globally unique Logical uri to reference this {{title}}
  Definition = An absolute URL that is used to identify this {{title}} when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this capability statement is (or will be) published
  Comments = Can be a urn:uuid: or a urn:oid:, but real http: addresses are preferred
  w5 = id

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.version
  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = y
  Type = string
  Short Name = Logical id for this version of the {{title}}
  Definition = The identifier that is used to identify this version of the {{title}} when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the {{title}} author manually and the value should be a timestamp
  Comments = There may be multiple different instances of a {{title}} that have the same identifier but different versions
  w5 = id.version

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------

  Summary = y
  Type = string
  Short Name = Informal name for this {{title}}
  Definition = A free text natural language name identifying the {{title}}
  Requirements = Support human navigation & code generation
  Comments = The name is not expected to be globally unique. The name should be a simple alpha-numeric type name to ensure it is computable friendly

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.status
  Card. = 1..1
  Is Modifier = yes
  Summary = y
  Type = code
  Binding = PublicationStatus

  Card. = 0..1
  Summary = y
  Type = dateTime
  Short Name = Date this was last changed
  Definition = The date  (and optionally time) when the {{title}} was published. The date must change when the business version changes, if it does, and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the {{title}} changes
  Comments = Note that this is not the same as the resource last-modified-date, since the resource may be a secondary representation of the {{title}}. Additional specific dates may be added as extensions
  w5 = when.recorded

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.useContext
  Card. = 0..*
  Summary = y
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = ConformanceUseContext
  Short Name = Content intends to support these contexts
  Definition = The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts that are listed. These terms may be used to assist with indexing and searching of code system definitions.
  Requirements = Assist in searching for appropriate content

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Element = MetadataResource.purpose
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = markdown
  Short Name = Why this {{title}} is defined
  Definition = Explains why this {{title}} is needed and why it has been designed as it has
  Comments = This element does not describe the usage of the {{title}} (See, e.g, the comments element), rather it\'s for traceability of \'\'why\'\' the resource is either needed or \'\'why\'\' it is defined as it is.  This may be used to point to source materials or specifications that drove the structure of this {{title}}
  Object Impl = no-gen-base
  w5 = why
