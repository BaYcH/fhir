<h2>Operations on the RESTful API</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http.html">RESTful API</a> defines a set of common operations performed on 
a repository of typed resources. These operations follow the RESTful paradigm of 
managing state by Create/Read/Update/Delete operations on a set of identified 
resources. While this approach solves many use cases, there is some specific 
functionality that can be met more efficiently using an RPC-like paradigm. 
This specification describes an operation framework that seamlessly extends
the RESTful API. 
</p>
<p>
Operations have the following general properties:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Each operation has a name</li>
 <li>Each operation has a list of 'in' and 'out' parameters</li>
 <li>The parameters are either resources, data types or search parameters</li>
 <li>The operations are subject to the same security arrangements as the RESTful API</li>
 <li>The URIs for the operation end points are based on the existing RESTful API address scheme</li>
 <li>The operations may make use of the existing repository of resources in their definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: the definition of these services does not prevent the use of other 
kinds of services not dependent on or integrated with the RESTful API.
</p>

<h3>FHIR defined Operations</h3>
<p>
This specification defines several operations:
</p>
<%operationslist%>
<p>
Implementations are able to define their own operations in addition to
those defined here. In order to minimize name clashes between operations
defined by different implementers, implementers should prefix the operation
name with a short code that identifies them sufficiently, such as ihe.[name].
Formally, name clashes can be resolved by use of the <a href="conformance.html">conformance statement</a>.
</p>

<h3>Defining an Operation</h3>

<p>
Each Operation is defined by:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A context for the operation - system, resource type, or resource instance</li>
 <li>A name for the operation</li>
 <li>A list of parameters, with their definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>
For each parameter, the following information is needed:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Name - the name of the operation. For implementer convenience, the name should be a valid token (see below)</li>
 <li>Use - In | Out | Both</li>
 <li>Type - a data type, a search parameter type, a resource type, or "Document". Out parameters must have a type which is a resource</li>
 <li>Documentation - describes its use</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that search parameter types are allowed for use where the parameter is used as a search parameter
i.e. to link between the context of operations, and a set of existing resources that the operation refers
to, where as data types and resources are used to provide information directly to the operation. The
definition of a parameter should make it's use clear. <i>To do: what about "date"?</i>
</p>

<h3>Executing an Operation</h3>

<p>
The URL for an operation end-point depends on its context:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>system: the url is [base]\$[name]</li>
 <li>resource type: the url is [base]\[type]\$[name]</li>
 <li>resource instance: the url is [base]\[type]\[id]\$[name]</li>
</ul>

<p>
An operation is invoked by performing an HTTP POST to the operation end-point.
The content of the body is a multipart/form-data that contains the parameters 
for the operation. Where the parameter type is a data type, the type may 
be represented as either json or xml; the root name of the object is the 
name of the parameter. 
</p>

<h4>Operation Output</h4>

<p>
If the operation succeeds, the HTTP Status code is 200 OK. An
HTTP status code if 4xx or 5xx indicates an error. User agents should 
note that servers may issue redirects etc to authenticate the client 
in response to an operation request.
</p>

<p>
If the result of the operation is a single resource, then the 
body of the response will be the resource. Note that the usual
arrangement in regard to <a href="http.html#mime-type">content type apply</a>.
If the result of the operation is more than one resource, then the 
server returns an atom feed with the resources. 
</p>
<p>
The resources that are returned by the operation may be 
retained and made available in the resource repository 
on the operation server. In that case, the server will 
provide the identity of the resource in the content-location
header in the response, or in the atom feed id/self link. When
resources that are not persisted are returned in an atom feed,
they should be assigned a cid: identifier that will never 
be re-used.
