        <b>STU Note:</b> The Public Health work group wants to draw the attention of reviewers and implementers to the following issues for feedback:
	</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The R3 Immunization resource contained a protocol backbone element which contained, among other elements, the doseSequence which indicates the dose number within the series. In R4, the protocol backbone element has been moved to the ImmunizationEvalation resource to allow independent evaluations of the immunization event. The removal of doseSequence is likely to be problematic for providers in Australian and New Zealand where they are required to report the dose sequence as part of the immunization event. We seek feedback on whether other jurisdictions also require the dose sequence. Options include adding doseSequence as part of the core resource or as an extension.</li>
		<li>The isPotent, subpotentReason, education, programEligibility and fundingSource are new elements and we would like feedback on the definition of these elements.</li>

<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The Immunization resource is intended to cover the recording of current and historical administration of vaccines to patients across all healthcare disciplines in all care settings and all regions. This includes immunization of both humans and animals but does not include the administration of non-vaccine agents, even those that may have or claim to have immunological effects.  
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the Immunization resource is expected to cover key concepts related to the creation, revision and querying of a patient's immunization history. This resource - through consultation with the Public Health work group - is believed to meet key use cases and information requirements as defined in the existing <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185">HL7 v2</a> immunization implementation guide, <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a> POIZ domain and Immunization Domain Analysis Model.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
This resource references the following resources:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Patient</li>
    <li>Practitioner</li>
    <li>Organization</li>
    <li>Location</li>
    <li>Encounter</li>
</ul>
<p>
Administration of vaccines is intended to be handled using the <b>Immunization</b> resource.  <a href="medicationadministration.html">MedicationAdministration</a> is intended for tracking the administration of non-vaccine medications.  Some systems treat immunizations in the same way as any other medication administration.  Such systems SHOULD use an immunization resource to represent these.  If systems need to use a <a href="medicationadministration.html">MedicationAdministration</a> resource to capture vaccinations for workflow or other reasons, they SHOULD also expose an equivalent <b>Immunization</b> instance.
