  		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
  	    <p><strong>This resource is a <em>request</em> resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a>.</strong></p>
  		<p>
  A <i>Diagnostic Request</i> is a record of a request for a set of diagnostic investigations to be performed.
  The investigation will lead to a <a href="diagnosticreport.html">Diagnostic Report</a> that summarizes the
  outcome of the investigation, and includes any useful data and/or images that are relevant to the
  treatment/management of the subject.
  </p>
  		<p>
  The principal intention of the <i>Diagnostic Request</i> is to support ordering diagnostic investigations
  on patients (which includes non-human patients in veterinary medicine). However in many contexts,
  healthcare related processes include performing diagnostic  investigations on groups of subjects,
  devices involved in the provision of healthcare, and even environmental locations such as ducts,
  bodies of water, etc. The <i>Diagnostic Request</i> supports all these usages.
  </p>
  		<p>
  The general work flow that this resource facilitates is that a clinical system creates a diagnostic
  order. The diagnostic order is then exchanged, perhaps via intermediaries, with a system that
  represents a diagnostic service that can perform the investigation as a request to do so.
  The diagnostic service will update the request as the work is performed, and then finally
  issue a report that references the requests that it fulfills.
  </p>
  <p>
  The DiagnosticRequest resource allows requesting only a single investigation.
  If a workflow requires requesting multiple items simultaneously, this is done using multiple instances of this resource.
  These instances can be linked in different ways, depending on the needs of the workflow. For guidance, refer to <a href="request.html#compound">the Request pattern</a>

<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<!-- Describes some of the situations/use cases intended to be managed with the resource. May include a child div for "Storyboards" and "Related Specifications". The purpose of this section is to help implementers understand why the resource is needed and how it might be used. -->
<p>
A <i>Procedure Request</i> is a record of a request for a procedure to be performed. It can
be used to represent a procedure that is planned, that is proposed, or that is ordered, as distinguished by
the value of the ProcedureRequestStatus field.
</p>
<p>
A procedure is an activity
that is performed with or on a patient as part of the provision of care. Examples include surgical
procedures, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic procedures, biopsies, counseling, physiotherapy, exercise, etc.
Procedures may be performed by a healthcare professional, a friend or relative or in some cases by the patient
themselves.
</p>
<p>
The procedure request may represent an order that is entered by a practitioner in a CPOE
system as well as a proposal made by a clinical decision support (CDS) system based
on a patient's clinical record and context of care. Planned procedures referenced by a
<a href="careplan.html">CarePlan</a> may also be represented by this resource.

		<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
		<p>
DiagnosticRequest is closely related to other types of "request" resources, particularly <a href="referralrequest.html">ReferralRequest</a> and <a href="procedurerequest.html">ProcedureRequest</a>. In fact, for some services, it may be appropriate to use any one of these resources to request that the service be performed. Which one is used may be driven by organization practice and by context. When it is unclear which to use, the following principles may be helpful:
        </p>

<ul>
				<li>
ProcedureRequest or DiagnosticRequest are typically used when the requesting clinician has and wishes to exercise the authority (and expertise) to decide exactly what action will be done.
</li>
				<li>
A ReferralRequest is used when the requesting practitioner is seeking another practitioner or organization to use their own expertise and/or authority to determine the specific action to take.
</li>
				<li>
Whether an activity is deemed to be a procedure or only a diagnostic order is typically driven by how invasive the diagnostic process is. More invasive processes are typically represented as procedures, though the dividing line will vary by organization.
</li>
			</ul>
<p>
Irrespective of the guidance above, systems should be prepared for some degree of overlap between these resources and be prepared to execute searches against multiple resources in cases where differentiation cannot be guaranteed. As well, in some workflows more than one type of resource or even all three might exist; e.g. Upon receiving a ReferralRequest a practitioner might initiate a DiagnosticRequest. The diagnostic service might then initiate a ProcedureRequest.
</p>
		<p>
The DiagnosticRequest supports references to the numerous other resources that define information about the subject - the requester, associated encounter, <!--specimen, -->body site and other supporting information.   For example, <a href = "patient.html">Patient</a>, <a href = "practitioner.html">Practitioner</a><!--, <a href="specimen.html">Specimen</a>--> and <a href="condition.html">Condition</a> are all referenced in this resource.  Some systems may choose to bundle up a DiagnosticRequest and this referenced information into a Document for delivery to the recipient. However, REST, Messaging and Services are also valid architectures for managing referrals and may be more appropriate where active workflow management is needed.
</p>
		<p>
CarePlan typically references DiagnosticRequest with a stage of "plan" or "proposal", though the requests may have to be initiated and authorized outside of the CarePlan.  Similarly ClinicalImpression resource can reference DiagnosticRequest as part of a follow up to plan to the assessment.

  <p>
  The notion of ProcedureRequest and <a href="communicationrequest.html">CommunicationRequest</a> are also closely related.
  The boundary between determining whether an action is
  considered to be training or counseling (and thus a ProcedureRequest) as opposed to a CommunicationRequest is based on whether
  there's a specific intent to change the mind-set of the patient.  A request to merely disclose information would be considered
  a CommunicationRequest.  Invocation of a process that will involve verification of the patient's comprehension or an attempt to
  change the patient's mental state would be a ProcedureRequest.

  <b>PLANNED CHANGE:</b>
  </p>
  <p style="text-decoration: line-through;">
  <b>ProcedureRequest</b> is one of the <a href="workflow.html#request">Request</a> resources in the FHIR <a href="workflow.html">Workflow</a> specification.  As such, it
  is expected to be adjusted to align with the <a href="request.html">Request</a> workflow pattern which will involve adding a number of additional data elements and potentially
  renaming a few elements.  Any concerns about performing such alignment are welcome as ballot comments and/or tracker items.
