<h2>
    Use of Procedure properties
</h2>
<p>
    Many of the elements of Procedure have inherent relationships and may actually all be conveyed  by the Procedure.code or in the text element 
    of the Procedure.code property. I.e. You may be able to infer category, bodySite and even indication. 
    Whether these other properties will be populated may vary by implementation. 
</p>
<p>    
    Care should be taken to avoid non-sensical combinations/statements. E.g. "name=amputation, bodySite=heart"
</p>
