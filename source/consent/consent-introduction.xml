<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
      <a name="PCD"> Privacy Consent Directive (PCD) </a>
 	  <p>
	  The purpose of this Resource is to be used to express a Privacy Consent Directive.
	  </p><p>
		Privacy policies define how Individually Identifiable Health Information (IIHI) is to be collected, accessed, 
		used and disclosed.  A Privacy Consent Directive is a record of a client’s (e.g., patient, consumer) 
		health information privacy policy.  A Privacy Consent Directive grants or withholds authorization to collect, 
		access, use, or disclose IIHI about the client. A client may author/publish their privacy preferences as a 
		self-declared Privacy Consent Directive.  Effective Privacy Consent Directives are a bilateral agreement between 
		the client and an individual/organization that is in accord with law, regulation and organizational policies with 
		regard to their content. In addition, Privacy Consent Directives provide the ability for a healthcare client 
		to delegate authority to a Substitute Decision Maker who may act on behalf of that individual.
	  </p><p>
		The Privacy Consent Directive resource on FHIR provides support for alternative representations for expressing 
		health information privacy consent directives in a standard form for the exchange of privacy policies 
		that can be enforced by consuming systems (e.g., scanned documents, computable structured entries).
	  </p><p>
		The Resource optionally supports backward compatibility by enabling references to CDA Consent Directives 
		following the 
		<a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/cbcc/frs/?action=FrsReleaseView&amp;release_id=732">HL7 CDAR2 ConsentDirective Implementation Guide</a> 
		which incorporated the 
		<a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Basic_Patient_Privacy_Consents">IHE Basic Patient Privacy Consents (BPPC)</a> 
		mechanism of acknowledging a Privacy Policy identifier and expanded upon it with privacy policy 
		attributes captured in the CDA document according to the CDA-CD-IG specification.  This guide allows for the 
		capture of a scanned document in the structuredBody of a CDA document to support manual interpretation of the 
		meaning of the privacy consent directive as well as to support the capture of a client’s wet signature.
	  
	  </p><p>
	    The Consent resource is structured with a base policy, followed by a listing of exceptions to that policy. 
		The exceptions can be additional positive or negative exceptions upon the base policy.
		</p>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
	  The scope of this Resource is a Privacy Consent Directive covering reasonable set of policies. 
	  The Consent supports a base minimal opt-in vs opt-out indication, 
	  with an attachment such as a scanned image of the ink on paper signature, and 
	  possibly with exceptions in a structured and coded way to support exceptions.
	  The set of exeptions include a list of data objects, list of authors, list of recipients, list of Organizations, list of purposeOfUse, and Date Range.
	  
      </p><p>
	  The enforcement of the Privacy Consent Directive is not included, but is expected that 
	  enforcement can be done using various Access Control enforcement methodologies (e.g. OAuth, UMA, XACML).
