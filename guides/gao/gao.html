      <h2>Guideline Appropriate Ordering FHIR Implementation Guide (IG)</h2>
      <p>The Guideline Appropriate Ordering Implementationg Guide does a bunch of stuff, see <a
          href="gao-toc.html">Table of Contents</a></p>
      <p>The Guideline Appropriate Ordering Profile supplies a mechanism by which EHR and
        departmental systems can evaluate orders to determine whether these orders conform to
        guidelines. The profile enables the results of the evaluation to be stored and transmitted,
        and the receiver of those results to verify that an order was evaluated with regard to
        appropriateness.</p>
      <p> Under a new US law<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, starting in 2017, providers ordering
        imaging procedures must use physician approved appropriateness guidelines to reduce
        unnecessary imaging in patients for whom it is not appropriate. In order to be paid for
        Medicare outpatient care, facilities and physicians who perform certain imaging procedures
        (either the technical or the clinical component) have to be able to show that decision
        support was used in the ordering process<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. The European
        Society of Cardiology and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging have also
        identified a need for use of appropriateness criteria in cardiovascular imaging<sup><a
            href="#fn3">3</a></sup>.</p>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>This implementation guide is intended to support the use cases where a Clinical Decision
        Support is consulted during the processing of an order to ensure that the requested services
        are appropriate according to clinical guidelines at the time of order entry. It does not
        address orders proposed by a clinical decision support system because it is presumed that
        the CDS system has already ensured that any proposed service is clinically appropriate.</p>
      <p>The focus of this guide is on ensuring that clinical decision support can be integrated
        into the ordering process. As far as this guide is concerned, the operation of CDS service
        itself is a black box. This guide does not express which guides are selected for the
        evaluation, how the evaluation is performed, or the formats used to express the guidance. </p>
      <p>However, we are interested in ensuring that this implementation guide is compatible with
        other mechanisms associated with clinical decision support, including <a
          href="http://www.hl7.org/special/Committees/projman/searchableProjectIndex.cfm?action=edit&amp;ProjectNumber=1187"
          >CDS on FHIR</a>. </p>
