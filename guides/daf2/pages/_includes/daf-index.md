[//]: # DAF Index.html

[Data Access Framework] is an US initiative sponsored by the  [Office of the National Coordinator (ONC)].  For this ballot there are two implementation guides (IG) and a set of core requirements as described below.

1. DAF
    -    [DAF-Core] : DAF-Core defines the minimum mandatory conformance requirements needed for accessing patient data.  These requirements have been developed based on the [Argonaut] pilot implementations. Implementations using the DAF-Core artifacts will be compliant with the DAF and Argonaut IGs. These DAF-Core components are being balloted with an STU status.
    -   [DAF IG] : The DAF IG defines all the supported conformance requirements for accessing patient data.  These requirements were originally developed, ballotted, and published in FHIR DSTU2.  They have been updated to reflect changes in the FHIR STU3 and content introduced by DAF-Core. (see above).  The DAF IG is being balloted with an STU status.
   
1. [DAF-Research IG] : The DAF-Research IG defines the conformance requirements for capabilities used by researchers to access data about multiple patients. These requirements have been developed based on the [PCORnet].  The DAF-Research IG is being balloted as "For Comments only ballot".
