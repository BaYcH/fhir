<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This section of the guide discusses the profiles and operation definitions used to meet the three main use cases of:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Sharing – The representation of computable knowledge artifacts</li>
	<li>Evaluation – The evaluation of knowledge artifacts</li>
	<li>Distribution – The exposure of a searchable repository of knowledge artifacts</li>
</ol>

<a name="sharing"/>
<h3>Sharing</h3>
<p>The Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification defines four types of artifacts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Event Condition Action (ECA) Rules</li>
	<li>Documentation Templates</li>
	<li>Order Sets</li>
	<li>Libraries</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these artifact types are represented in this guide by a separate structure defining the specific structures involved. Each of these structures is derived from the KnowledgeModule structure defined in the common section.</p>

<p>In addition, to support the use of artifacts defined within the existing specification, a GuidanceArtifact structure is introduced that allows CDS KAS artifacts to be used directly.</p>

<a name="eca-rules"/>
<h4>Event Condition Action (ECA) Rules</h4>

<p>As the name implies, ECA rules define actions that should be taken whenever some condition is met in response to a particular event. This implementation guide defines three types of events that can trigger the evaluation of an ECA rule:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Named Event</li>
	<li>Scheduled Event</li>
	<li>Data Event</li>
</ul>

<p>A named event is an event identified by the implementation environment. This type of event allows ECA rules to be triggered by any event generated within the implementation environment. A scheduled event occurs on a fixed or periodic schedule. And finally, a data event occurs in response to some data-related event in the integrated environment such as a record being added or updated.</p>

<p>An ECA rule may have any number of events that can trigger the rule. Note that this may also be zero, as the rule may be evaluated by direct request. Also note that because ECA rules are shareable artifacts, the definition of the triggering events must be utilized by the implementation environment to determine when to invoke the rule.</p>

<p>Each ECA rule must have a single condition that is evaluated whenever any of the events occur. If this condition evaluates to true, the actions defined by the rule should be performed.</p>

<p>And finally, each ECA rule defines actions that should be performed. This implementation guide defines the following types of actions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create</li>
	<li>Update</li>
	<li>Delete</li>
	<li>Fire Event</li>
</ul>

<p>The Create, Update, and Delete actions indicate that particular resources should be created, modified, or removed, and the Fire Event action indicates that a particular named event should occur.</p>

<a name="documentation-templates"/>
<h4>Documentation Templates</h4>

<p>A documentation template is a structured form for recording information on a patient into a set of pre-defined data slots. These templates are used to guide structure data entry within an EHR or other clinical information system. Some examples of clinical documents that can be represented via documentation template artifacts are encounter summaries, procedure notes, patient-reported outcomes, and flowsheets.</p>

<p>Within FHIR, the Questionnaire resource is available for modeling the structure of questionnaires. As such, the Documentation Template artifact is realized as a derivative of KnowledgeModule that adds a reference to a particular Questionnaire.</p>

<p>However, Documentation Templates as described by the Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification allow not only questions to be defined, but the behavior of the questionnaire as well. For example, whether or not to display a particular question or group of questions based on answers to previously asked questions, or calculating the value of an answer based on other answers. The Questionnaire resource by itself does not provide this functionality, so this guide introduces a DocumentationTemplate profile of the Questionnaire resource to allow this behavior to be modeled.</p>

<p>The content of a documentation template artifact is then specified by referencing either a Questionnaire directly, or a DocumentationTemplate if behavioral functionality is required.</p>

<a name="order-sets"/>
<h4>Order Sets</h4>

<p>An order set is a pre-defined and approved group of orders related to a particular clinical condition (e.g. hypertension treatment and monitoring) or stage of care (e.g. hospital admission to Coronary Care Unit). An order set is used as a checklist for the clinician when managing a patient with a specific condition. It is a structured collection of orders relevant to that condition and presented to the clinician in a computerized provider order entry system (CPOE).</p>

<p>Within this implementation guide, the OrderSet structure is derived from KnowledgeModule and introduces the ability to define hierarchical groups of orderables, together with behaviors that determine how the orderable items are related to eachother.</p>

<p>In general, each orderable is a template-level description of a specific FHIR resource, with the order set definition providing for additional behavioral components by defining expressions for the values of various components of the orderable that are evaluated in context when the order set is presented. This allows the general description of the order set to be presented structurally, while still allowing for maximum flexibility and customization of the contents based on the patient, encounter, and setting at the point-of-care.</p>

<a name="libraries"/>
<h4>Libraries</h4>

<p>Libraries were introduced into the Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification as a means of reusing components of artifact definitions. While this is an important use case, for the purposes of this comment-only ballot, its implementation has been deferred. We seek comment on the use case for reusing components of artifact definitions and whether this is a critical requirement that should be covered by this implementation guide.</p>

<a name="guidance-artifacts"/>
<h4>Guidance Artifacts</h4>

<p>In order to allow existing artifacts defined according to the current Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification, this implementation guide defines a GuidanceArtifact structure derived from KnowledgeModule, but whose content is determined by a DocumentReference to a CDS KAS artifact.</p>

<a name="evaluation"/>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>For the evaluation use case, this implementation guide defines the GuidanceRequest and GuidanceResponse structures, derived from KnowledgeRequest, and KnowledgeResponse, respectively. These guidance-level structures introduce clinical decision support-specific information such as the requesting and recipient organizations and/or persons, as well as the workflow context.</p>

<p>In addition, the GuidanceResponse structure introduces elements for representing the actions to be performed in response to a guidance evaluation request.</p>

<a name="distribution"/>
<h3>Distribution</h3>

<p>The distribution use case functionality as described within the common section of this implementation guide is sufficient for the clinical decision support use case. As such, this section does not introduce any new functionality in support of the distribution use case.</p>
